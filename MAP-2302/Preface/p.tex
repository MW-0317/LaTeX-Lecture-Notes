Welcome to my LaTex written notes for MAP-2302, or Differential Equations. I wanted to attempt to be able to write notes for mathematical classes since MAC2302 or Calculus 3 after seeing the beautiful blogs and notes by Gilles Castel, so much of what I create and design inside these notes are based on his work. Check out his website here: \href{https://castel.dev}{https://castel.dev}.
