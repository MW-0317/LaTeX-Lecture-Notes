\section{Vibrations}

The simplist vibration model is of a spring.

The most ideal case in a spring, where $k$ is the stiffness.

\begin{equation*}
    my''=-ky
\end{equation*}
Where the solution is
\begin{equation*}
    y=cos(wt)
\end{equation*}
Where $w = \sqrt{\frac km}$.

% GRAPH THIS EQUATION OF y=cos(wt)

If in a viscous fluid the equation becomes more complicated where viscosity is taken into consideration.

\begin{equation*}
    my''=-ky-by'
\end{equation*}
